## Purpose

I built this the project because I was curious as to whether a split digital keyboard would be useful. I first looked to see if there was a way that I could do it without coding, saw it was possible but not on my iphone so I decided to create a UI mock and then I ended up creating the thing.

## My Brag of the Project

I wanted to make it customizable as much as possible so most UI is generated based on data allowing people to customize their keyboard to their heart's content be that a key that types the phrase: "I love Linux" or a key that deletes 200 characters.

## Lessons Learned

- Don't ever start with javascript again
- I could have fun creating something with my sibling, frantically trying to fix the bugs they kept finding in real time using a live server with hot reload.
