## Purpose

I built this project because I was curious as to whether a split digital keyboard would be useful. I first looked to see if there was a way that I could do it without coding, saw it was possible but not on my iphone so I decided to create a UI mock and then that turned into a proof of concept which then turned into a demo and eventually it ended up being this highly customizable offline pwa.

## My Brag of the Project

I wanted to make it as customizable as possible so most UI elements are generated based on data allowing people to customize their keyboard to their heart's content be that a key that types the phrase: "I love Linux" or a key that deletes 200 characters.

## Lessons Learned

- Don't ever start with JavaScript again
- I could have fun creating something with my sibling, frantically trying to fix the bugs as they kept finding them in real time using a live server with hot reload.
